## Project characteristics 

As a tourist, I would like to see some recommendations on which country I should visit next. These recommendations will be based on different criteria such as: Visa requirements, average prices of hotels/accommodations, average flight ticket price coming from country of origin, and number of tourists who visited the country from different countries including: EU(Schengen), USA, Japan, Singapore, Australia, and Canada.  



# Used data sources
* [Airbnb data from major cities](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)
* [Passport index](https://github.com/ilyankou/passport-index-dataset)
* [Flight prices data scraped from](https://www.kayak.com/)
* [Tourist Data for each EU country](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tour_dem_ttw/default/table?lang=en)

# Used packages
* Anvil - A framework used for developing web applications with Python
* Pandas - Library used for data analytics and manipulation
* Numpy - for scientific computing with Python.
* Matplotlib - comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
* BeautifulSoup - Package for parsing HTML
* Selenium Webdriver - Used for automated web browsing for scraping data


## The general elements of a program (pseudo-code)
* User interacts with a front-end interface built on Anvil
* Front-end will interact with a service layer which performs the data analysis
* Users can select whether to get recommendations for a travel destination or just explore a destination.
* Datasets on Visa will be loaded using pandas and visualized using the world map
* Flight and accommodation prices will be loaded based on the selected country and visualized using a histogram
* Will show top 5 recommendations and show some interesting landmarks on the country and places to visit


## Main problems that occurred during the implementation
* No available dataset on flight prices can be obtained online so a web scraper was built using Selenium and BeautifulSoup
* Due to large amounts of data, only countries of interest will be chosen
